# SimpleHttpWebServerPythonExample

This is an example repo for students to create a simple webserver using Python. 

For the web development class, students may either use [Repl](https://repl.it/) or develop locally. 
If they choose to develop locally, there are certain functionalities that require a working webserver (which Repl automatically gives you).

For the guide in how to create a simple HTTP Webserver with Python, follow this slide:
